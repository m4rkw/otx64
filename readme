otx64: php script interface for dumping the 64bit sections of Mach-O binary executables.
by mark@wadham.me   http://github.com/m4rkw

::: Introduction

otx64 was inspired by http://otx.osxninja.com/

otx is not compatible with 64-bit Mach-O binaries, which made me sad :( so i knocked up this script to 
dump out useful asm listings with the bytecode and real file offsets from Mach-O 64-bit binaries.

This is very useful for reverse engineering, hacking etc.

::: What's this 4096 offset thing about then?

So far all the 64-bit binaries I've found have their __text code section exactly 4096 bytes from where
otool -l says it should be.  This is taken care off in the program with a default offset of 4096, which
can be adjusted using the -o parameter if necessary.  If you find any 64-bit Mach-O binaries that have
different offsets please let me know!

Example, otool shows the offset of the __text section:

$ otool -arch x86_64 -l file |grep __text -A5
  sectname __text
   segname __TEXT
      addr 0x00002fa8
      size 0x000422c5
    offset 5104
     align 2^2 (4)

This means that the actual offset of the start of the code will be 5104+4096 (decimal).

otx64 takes care of this adjustments so the offsets shown in left column of the output are the real
offsets in the file that you can jump to in a hex editor to view/edit the bytecode.

::: Usage

Very simply just:

otx64 [-o <offset>] <file>

Code is split up into functional blocks similar to the otx output. The output columns are:

<file offset>    <code offset>      <bytecode>       <instruction>
